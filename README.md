# playlist_selection
Create an algorithm in Python that will randomly select a song to practice on my bass guitar from a list of songs.
I play bass guitar in a band called Sofa Locusts. We have wide genre of songs we're in the process of learning from - blues, funk, punk, reggae, classic rock, jam band, R&B. When I practice, I tend to keep choosing the same songs to practice and not branching out to explore and practice all the songs in our play list. To that end, I decided to create an algorithm in Python that would randomly choose a song for me to practice from the playlist each time I practice. This will allow me to get a well-rounded exposure to all the songs and genres that we are learning, which will make me a better bass player and in turn will improve the band. 

As of Sept 15, 2017, I have created a dictionary of songs (dict_songs.py) that has a song title and the key to play it in as the key value pairs. When this program is run, it asks if the user would like to play a song. If the answer is yes, the program randomly chooses a song title (along with the key to play it in) for the user. If the answer is no, the program is just supposed to reply, 'ok, maybe tomorrow.' However when I choose No or no or N or n, the program still gives me a song title and the key to play it in and then says 'ok, maybe tomorrow.' I think it is doing it because of my random command that tells the program to choose a song randomly from the list. I need to find a way to combine that with just the yes response and separate it from the no response.

In addition to solving the issue in the previous paragraph, I want several dictionaries of songs sorted by genre (punk, blues, reggae...). Then I want the program to ask what genre the person wants to play, no requesting the same genre twice and then I want it to pull a song randomly from that genre. I'm not sure how to do that yet, I think nesting all of the dictionaries in a list might do it. Time will tell!
